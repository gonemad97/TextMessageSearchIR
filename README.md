# TextMessageSearchIR
Information Retrieval Final Project - Search engine to search for specific phrases in text messages

Refer to the Documentation to understand the project and the concepts used.

Requirements are Python, Flask, Elasticsearch Python Client and BeautifulSoup.

Start Elasticsearch by finding the bin folder where it was installed and giving the ./elasticsearch command (Mac).
Run webapp.py to start the engine.

crawler_main.py contains the crawler and movies_list_full_paras.pickle is the object containing the entire dataset, so the crawler does not need to be ran again.
