Refer to the Documentation to understand the project and the concepts used.

Requirements are Python, Flask, Elasticsearch Python Client and BeautifulSoup.

Start Elasticsearch by finding the bin folder where it was installed and giving the ./elasticsearch command (Mac).


Run ```webapp.py``` to start the engine.



```crawler_main.py``` contains the crawler and ```movies_list_full_paras.pickle``` is the object containing the entire dataset, so the crawler does not need to be run again.
